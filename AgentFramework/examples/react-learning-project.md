@agent-front-qa create user profile components with form validation and responsive design

# Day 3: Integration and testing
@agent-front-qa integrate profile components with authentication and create testing strategy

# Result: Complete feature in 3 days vs ~1 week manual
```

### **Performance Optimization Initiative**
```bash
# Analysis phase
@agent-arq-pro analyze current React app performance and identify bottlenecks

# Implementation phase
@agent-arq-pro implement code splitting and lazy loading for routing optimization
@agent-front-qa optimize PrimeReact component usage and bundle size

# Validation phase  
@agent-front-qa create performance testing setup and validate improvements

# Result: 40% bundle size reduction, 60% faster initial load
```

### **Problem Resolution: Authentication Issues**
```bash
# Problem: Complex authentication state management issues
@agent-dios-lite investigate authentication persistence issues and implement robust solution

# Result: Complete authentication system with proper state management in 4 hours vs 2 days debugging

## 📋 Lessons Learned

### **What Works Exceptionally Well**
1. **Single agent tasks**: @agent-front-qa and @agent-arq-pro handle 95% of work efficiently
2. **Clear boundaries**: No confusion about which agent to use for what
3. **Learning acceleration**: Guided best practices from day one
4. **Quality consistency**: All code follows same patterns and standards

### **When Multiple Agents Are Needed**
1. **Complex refactoring**: @agent-coord-lite helps coordinate changes across multiple files
2. **Integration challenges**: Coordination helps when frontend and architecture decisions conflict
3. **Learning blockers**: @agent-dios-lite for deep research and autonomous problem solving

### **Efficiency Patterns**
```bash
# High efficiency (90% of tasks)
Single agent direct execution:
@agent-front-qa → UI/UX tasks
@agent-arq-pro → Architecture/performance tasks

# Medium efficiency (8% of tasks)
Two-agent coordination:
@agent-coord-lite → plan complex changes
@agent-arq-pro → implement architectural aspects
@agent-front-qa → implement UI aspects

# Lower efficiency but necessary (2% of tasks)
Research-intensive tasks:
@agent-dios-lite → autonomous problem solving with web research
```
