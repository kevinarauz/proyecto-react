### **@agent-solver** - Research + Emergency
**Usage**: 5% of tasks (when blocked)
**Consolidates**: Problem solving + research + autonomous resolution
**Scope**: Emergency problem solving, external research

## 🎯 When to Use TIER 1

### **✅ Perfect For**:
- Learning new technologies (like your React project)
- Building MVPs or prototypes quickly
- Single developer or small team projects  
- Projects with clear, simple requirements
- Time-constrained development (hackathons, demos)
- Experimenting with new frameworks

### **❌ Not Suitable For**:
- Production enterprise applications
- Multiple team coordination
- Complex business logic requirements
- Compliance-heavy environments
- Distributed systems architecture

## ⚡ Workflow Examples

### **Simple Feature Development**
```bash
# Single agent execution (80% cases)
@agent-front-lite create responsive login component with validation

@agent-arq-lite optimize React bundle size and identify bottlenecks
```

### **Medium Complexity Feature**
```bash  
# 2-agent coordination (15% cases)
@agent-coord-nano plan user profile feature affecting 3 components
@agent-front-lite implement user profile UI based on coordination plan
@agent-arq-lite validate architecture decisions and performance impact
```

### **Problem Solving**
```bash
# Emergency research (5% cases)
@agent-solver investigate and fix React hydration issues in SSR setup
```

## 📋 Success Metrics

### **Performance Targets**
- **Task completion time**: 5-30 minutes average
- **Context switching**: <3 agent handoffs per task
- **Decision paralysis**: Eliminated (clear agent boundaries)
- **ROI**: >150% efficiency gain vs manual development

### **Quality Standards**
- **Code consistency**: Maintained through consolidated expertise
- **Learning velocity**: Accelerated through guided best practices
- **Technical debt**: Minimal accumulation due to architectural guidance
- **Developer satisfaction**: High due to reduced complexity

## 🛠️ Technology Adaptations

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### **1. Project Assessment**
```bash
# Evaluate if TIER 1 is right for your project
- Files: <100
- Team: 1-3 developers
- Complexity: Simple to moderate
- Timeline: Weeks to few months
```

### **2. Agent Setup**
```bash
# Copy agent templates to your project
# Adapt templates for your technology stack
# Configure technology-specific patterns
```

### **3. First Task**
```bash
# Start with simple single-agent task
@agent-front-lite analyze current UI and suggest 3 specific improvements

# Progress to multi-agent when needed
@agent-coord-nano coordinate refactor affecting login + dashboard + navigation
```

## 📈 Scaling to Higher Tiers

### **Signs You Need TIER 2 (BALANCED)**
- Team grows to 4+ developers
- Requirements become more complex
- Multiple systems integration needed
- Business logic complexity increases
- Performance requirements become critical

### **Migration Path**
1. **Assess current project complexity**
2. **Identify which specialized agents are needed**
3. **Gradually introduce TIER 2 agents**
4. **Maintain TIER 1 efficiency where possible**
5. **Monitor ROI and team satisfaction**
